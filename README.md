# VBA_Snippets
## About VBA_Snippets
VBA_Snippets was created in order to better faciliate a uniform body of quality VBA code for common tasks. The goal of this repository is to create the most effective version of a process and make it available to everyone so they can better focus on process and project improvements instead of fighting against how to create multi-level directories within VBA (see:<a href="https://github.com/abelgoodwin1988/vba_snippets/blob/master/io/makeMultiMkdir.vb">makeMultiMkdir</a>).

I hope through your contributions and corrections we can make this a useful tool.

## Structure - Use
As of 9/14/2017 I'm not sure how I want the folder structure to work. I figure we'll have locations for application specific code snippets and then have commonly applicable code in topic folders based in the root. If you have a better layout, do a Pull Request and we'll work it out together!

Other than that, if you know you have a specific reference library you need or are working within a specific application check that applications directory and sub directories for the code you may want. If you don't find what you need and believe it's something common and/or widely applicable, please add it via pull request!
